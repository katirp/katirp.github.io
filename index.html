        <p class="paragraph">Hello! I'm a final-year Computer Science and Linguistics student at UCLA. To me, coding is
          a
          powerful tool for tackling the issues I care about most. My interests span education, oceanography, and
          leveraging data to inform criminal justice decisions. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          I'm passionate about full-stack development and design, and outside of work, I love 3D modeling, camping, and
          anything related to the ocean. I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow, so feel free to
          reach
          out! You can connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kati-rp/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>
          and

      <h2>Software Engineering Internship @ Expedia Group</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        During the summer of 2024, I worked in Expedia Group's Chicago office as a Software Development Engineering
        Intern on a cloud infrastructure team.
        I developed a recommendation engine in Typescript for customers' Kubernetes Helm charts within
        Backstage, reducing runtime errors and achieving significant cost savings for the business.
        I resolved complex issues involving Kubernetes, Docker, GitHub Actions, Spinnaker, and AWS,
        enhancing system reliability and operational efficiency. </p>
      <h2>Full-stack Developer @ Nova, Tech For Good</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I worked on creating a web app and database for the Blood and Platelet Center to store blood drive data. This
        app allows organizations to sign up for blood donation drives and for BPC admin to seamlessly manage upcoming
        drives.
        I devised a data storage hierarchy schema to securely and efficiently store confidential blood drive
        information in a Firebase database. I also constructed over half of the front-facing website following best
        UI/UX practices and using Typescript, React, and HTML/CSS.

      <h2>Ascii Filter Video Generation</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">I created a tool in Python which takes a video file as input and returns a video where the
        pixels in each
        frame have been converted to ascii characters according to their value.</p>
      <p>You can try it out <a href=" https://asciify-a254147d701d.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">here.</a> (It works
        best with videos less than 5 seconds.)</p>
      <p class="paragraph"></p>
      <h2>3D Modelling</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Inspired by Japanese Gachapon blind boxes, I created and modelled my original character, Bobotan, using
        Blender. I prototyped the models by printing them with PLA filament 3D printers, then printed the final
        versions with a resin printer. The series includes Bobotan in 6 different poses.
      </p>
      <p>Bobotan is a mysterious bunny who is always seen wearning a mask. </p>
