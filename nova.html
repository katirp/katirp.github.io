        I worked on creating a web app and database for the Blood and Platelet Center to store blood drive data. This app allows organizations to sign up for blood donation drives and for BPC admin to seamlessly manage upcoming drives.        
        I devised a data storage hierarchy schema to securely and efficiently store confidential blood drive information in a Firebase database. I also constructed over half of the front-facing website following best UI/UX practices and using Typescript, React, and HTML/CSS.
