                During the summer of 2024, I worked in Expedia Group's Chicago office as a Software Development Engineering Intern on a cloud infrastructure team.
                I developed a recommendation engine in Typescript for customers' Kubernetes Helm charts within
                Backstage, reducing runtime errors and achieving significant cost savings for the business.
                I resolved complex issues involving Kubernetes, Docker, GitHub Actions, Spinnaker, and AWS,
                enhancing system reliability and operational efficiency.            </p>
